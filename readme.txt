== Description ==

A full-featured testimonials plugin that works right out of the box for beginners with advanced features for pros, backed by strong support.

**[Go Demo](http://demos.wpmission.com/strong-testimonials/)** | **[Knowledge Base](https://support.strongplugins.com/article-category/strong-testimonials/)** | **[Add-ons](https://strongplugins.com/plugins/category/strong-testimonials/)**

### Is this the right plugin for you?

Intended use case: A small business with up to a few hundred testimonials or reviews, maybe using categories for different products or services, that needs flexible display options and a customizable form for accepting new testimonials.

If that describes you, this plugin will work in just a few steps.

### Primary Features

* No complicated shortcode "language"
* A front-end form with custom fields
* Star ratings
* Slider with several navigation options
* Grid, columns, and Masonry
* Ready for translation with [WPML](https://wpml.org/), [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/), and [WPGlobus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpglobus/)
* A developer who's on your side :)

### More Features

* Sort by oldest, newest, random, or menu order (drag-and-drop)
* Categories
* Excerpts and "Read more" links
* Featured Images (thumbnails) and Gravatars
* Pagination
* Developer-friendly

### Testimonial Submission Form

Customize the form by adding or removing fields and changing properties like the order, label, and placeholder.

**Anti-spam** measures include honeypots and Captcha via these plugins:

* [Advanced noCaptcha reCaptcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-nocaptcha-recaptcha/)
* [Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha/) and [Captcha Pro](https://bestwebsoft.com/products/wordpress/plugins/captcha/)
* [Really Simple Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/)

Send custom **notification emails** to multiple admins.

Submit the form via Ajax to use with popular plugins like [Popup Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker/).

### Displaying Testimonials

Everything happens in a **view**. Instead of learning multiple shortcodes with dozens of options, a view contains all the options in a simple, intuitive editor that no other testimonial plugin has.

Display the view using a single shortcode or the widget.

Create unlimited views. For example, one view for a form, another for a static grid, another for a slideshow, and so on.

### Style

Strong Testimonials offers a handful of templates to try in your theme. The default template is just generic enough to look good in most cases with maybe a few tweaks.

Need help matching your theme? Got some weird spacing or floating? I'm here to help.

For ultimate control and seamless integration, copy any template to your theme and customize it. There is also a template function `<?php strong_testimonials_view( $id ); ?>`.

### Pro Add-ons

#### Review Markup

Testimonials are essentially five-star reviews. Adding review markup will encourage search engines to display rich snippets in search results. [Learn more](https://strongplugins.com/plugins/strong-testimonials-review-markup/)

#### Multiple Forms

Need more forms for different products or services? No problem. Create unlimited forms. [Learn more](https://strongplugins.com/plugins/strong-testimonials-multiple-forms/)

#### Properties

Want to rename "testimonials" to "reviews"? Want to change the permalink structure? [Learn more](https://strongplugins.com/plugins/strong-testimonials-properties/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the shortcodes? =

[testimonial_view] - To display your testimonials as a list or a slideshow, or to display the form. There are no complicated shortcode options. Instead, a **view** manages all the options with an easy-to-use (some call it fun!) editor for creating unlimited views.

`[testimonial_view id=1]`

[testimonial_count] - To display the number of testimonials you have. For example:

`Read some of our [testimonial_count] testimonials!`

= Can I add testimonials from YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram? =

Yes. The plugin supports the [WordPress embed](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) feature for inserting testimonials from [these sources](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds#Does_This_Work_With_Any_URL.3F).

= Can I change the fields on the form? =

Yes. There is a custom fields editor to add or remove fields, change field details, and drag-and-drop to reorder them.

= After the form has been submitted, can I redirect them to another page or display a custom message? =

Yes and yes.

= Can I set the status of the newly submitted testimonial? =

Yes, either pending or published.

= Can I reorder my testimonials by drag and drop? =

Yes.

= Can I change the fields that appear below the testimonial? =

Yes. In views, change these custom fields in a few clicks.

= Can I display a large version of the featured image in a popup? =

Yes. This requires a lightbox so if your theme does not include one, you will need a plugin like [Simple Colorbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-colorbox/).

= Will it automatically use my existing testimonials? =

No. If you already have testimonials in another plugin or theme, you will have to re-enter them. Why? Because every theme and plugin stores data differently.

= Can I import my existing testimonials? =

It depends. The plugin does not provide an import tool because every situation is different. With some technical skills, you may be able to successfully export your existing testimonials to a CSV file and import them into Strong Testimonials. Contact me if you want help with that. Otherwise, it may be simpler and easier to migrate them manually.

= Is it true that including a link to my site in my support requests really helps you troubleshoot problems? =

Undeniably, yes.

This [screenshot](http://www.screencast.com/t/TPMRWM0yug) shows where I immediately start looking for clues before asking for more information and potentially waiting hours or days for a response (it happens).

I can determine what theme you're using, what plugins are active, whether you're using any caching/minification/optimization (do you need to clear your cache?), if there are any JavaScript errors in your theme or another plugin (more common than you may think), and somewhat how the testimonial view is configured.

If you prefer not to post your URL publicly, start a private support ticket at [support.strongplugins.com](https://support.strongplugins.com).
